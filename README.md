## Installation

You can install either manually or via npm.  The latter is very simple:

    npm install codemirror-find-and-replace-dialog

## Usage

Add the following imports.
```javascript
import "codemirror-find-and-replace-dialog/dist/search.js";
import "codemirror-find-and-replace-dialog/dist/dialog.js";
import "codemirror-find-and-replace-dialog/dist/dialog.css";
```

## Dependencies

Obviously you need to include CodeMirror in the page.  You also need to include `addon/display/panel.js` from the CodeMirror default installation.
